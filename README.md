> An application that allows a user to create and manage multisig wallets on the Elrond Network.

# Usage

This application can be started with a single multisig contract and
integrated into other applications as needed.

To configure the application to run for a specific contract with a specific alias as a name, 
one has  to edit the multisigConfig.ts file as follows:

```
export const uniqueContractAddress = 'your contract address';

export const uniqueContractName = 'contract user-friendly name';
```

Please bear in mind that the addres has to be a valid multisig address for the application to work.
